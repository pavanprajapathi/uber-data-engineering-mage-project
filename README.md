# uber data analytics | modern data engineering GCP project
## introduction: 
This project aims to construct a robust data engineering pipeline on GCP to analyze Uber-like data. We'll leverage Mage AI for efficient ETL, store processed data in BigQuery for scalable querying, and visualize key insights through Looker Studio. Cloud Storage will serve as the foundation for data ingestion and storage.
